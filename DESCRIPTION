Description: A tool that assists the user in two tasks: the map reading
    process and the data representation process. The reading process is
    leveraged with functions that allow the user to find maps in the Siane
    repository easily, i.e. searching by map year or administrative level.
    The other main functionality is to bind numerical data to polygons.
    This package is only compatible with the spanish IGN(National
    Institute of Geography) maps and the INE(National Institute of
    Statistics) data.
